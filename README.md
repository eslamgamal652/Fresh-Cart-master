With a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and an exceptional user experience, Fresh Cart aims to revolutionize the way users shop for their favorite products.
It is a React JS-powered project that allows users to shop for products in an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The project harnesses the power of Context API for efficient state management, enabling users to browse through the home page, filter by categories, search for products, add items to the cart, and more - all in real-time.
